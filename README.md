# Basic HTML & CSS Training

### Created these files for a 2h basic HTML & CSS training. 

Using [bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) starter HTML template as well as css classes and grid to bootstrap a simple site in limited time.

The purpose of the presentation is to show how easy it is to actually build simple one-page sites or landing pages with limited HTML and CSS knowledge. 

Also, how simple HTML actually is and how many amazing tools (like Bootstrap) are out there to be used by non-developers to make the what once was a complex task into a pick-and-choose puzzle.
